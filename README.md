## 🗽 NYPD Arrest Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project investigates arrest records from the **NYPD (New York Police Department)** dataset to explore patterns and trends in crime across New York City. Using Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries—**Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**—we break down the data by **borough, offense type, age group, race, and gender**, offering meaningful insights into how arrests vary across different dimensions.

### 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** NYPD Arrest Data (public dataset)
